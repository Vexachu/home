KidCoder · Scratch Lessons
==========================

How to use
----------
1) Drop this entire `lessons/` folder into the root of your site (next to `index.html`).
2) The pages link back to `../../index.html` by default. If your path is different, edit the `home_rel` link in each page's `<header>`.
3) Replace placeholder images:
   - `screenshot-interface.png`, `screenshot-blocks.png`, `placeholder-diagram.png` in each lesson folder.
4) For videos, replace `VIDEO_ID_HERE` with your YouTube ID.

Attribution for screenshots
---------------------------
On pages where you include Scratch interface screenshots, include this note (per Scratch guidance):

  "Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu".
